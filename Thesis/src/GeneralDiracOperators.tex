\section{Connections}
%
We previously defined the Dirac operator $D$ on $\R^n$ and explored some
instances of $D$ in low dimensions. The constructions implicitly used the
Riemannian geometry on $\R^n$, along with its associated Spin structure.
To explore the Dirac operator in more generality on manifolds, we need to
develop some of the Riemannian geometry in the nonlinear world of manifolds.
%TODO Motivate connections, distributions, generalization of vector fields
%
\begin{defn}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A \ib{distribution} on $X$ is a vector subbundle
$E \subset TX$.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}
let $\pi : E \to M$ be a fiber bundle. The map $\pi$ determines a distinguished
subspace $\ker d\pi_e \subset T_eE$, called the \ib{vertical subspace}
which defines a distribution $V$ over $E$ called the \ib{vertical distribution}.
A \ib{connection} on $E$ is another distribution $H \subset TE$ such that
at every point $e \in E$, we have $V_e \oplus H_e = T_eE$. In other words,
it is a choice of splitting of the short exact sequence of vector bundles
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & V \ar[r] & TE \ar[r] & \pi^*TM \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
If $E$ is a principal $G$-bundle, we ask for the horizontal distribution $H$
to be $G$-invariant, i.e. $H_{p \cdot g} = d(R_g)_p(H_p)$, where $R_g : E \to E$
denotes the right action of $g \in G$.
\end{defn}
%TODO Space of splittings is affine over Hom(T_{\pi(e)}M, V)
%TODO, connections exist?
Having defined a connection, we should check that such an object actually exists.
To show this, we first need a few lemmas.
%
\begin{defn}
Let
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r, "\varphi"] & B \ar[r, "\psi"] & C \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
be a short exact sequence of vector spaces. A \ib{splitting} of this
exact sequence is a map $i : C \to B$ such that $\varphi \circ i = \id_C$.
If a splitting exists, we say that the short exact sequence splits.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{lem}
Every short exact sequence of vector spaces
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r, "\varphi"] & B \ar[r, "\psi"] & C \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
splits.
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof} %TODO

\end{proof}
%
\begin{lem}
The space of splittings of a short exact sequence
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r, "\varphi"] & B \ar[r, "\psi"] & C \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
is an affine space over $\hom(C,B)$,
i.e. the difference $i - j$ can be canonically identified with an element of
$\hom(C,A)$.
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof}
Let $i,j : C \to B$ be splittings of the exact sequence, and let
$c \in C$. Then since $i$ and $j$ are splittings,
\[
\psi((i-j)(c)) = \psi(i(c)) - \psi(j(c)) = c - c = 0
\]
Therefore, $(i-j)(c) \in \ker\psi$, so by exactness, there exists an $a \in A$
such that $\varphi(a) = (i-j)(c)$. By exactness, we know $\varphi$ is injective,
so this $a$ is unique. Therefore, the mapping $c \mapsto \varphi\inv((i-j)(c))$
defines the desired linear map $C \to A$.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{prop}
Given a fiber bundle $\pi : E \to F$, a connection $H \subset TE$ exists.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}%TODO
Over any point $e \in E$, the space of splittings of
$0 \to V_e \to TE_e \to (\pi^*TM)_e$ is affine over $\hom((\pi^*TM))_e \to V_e)$.
\end{proof}
