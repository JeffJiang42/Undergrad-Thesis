\section{Dirac Operators}
%
To discuss Dirac operators on manifolds, we restrict the previous discussion
to the case where the principal bundle we're concerned with is the principal
bundle of frames $\B(M)$ (or subbundles like $\B_O(M)$ and $\B_{SO}(M))$.
The covariant derivative has a very geometric interpretation
when applied to the $GL_n\R$ bundle of frames $\pi : \B(M) \to M$.
The natural action of $GL_n\R$ on $\R^n$ allows us to
define the associated vector bundle $\B(M) \times_{GL_n\R} \R^n$, which is
naturally isomorphic to the tangent bundle $TM$ as we showed before. We can then
define a natural $1$-form $\theta \in \Omega_{\B(M)}(\R^n)$ called the
\ib{soldering form}. Given $b \in \B(M)$, we know that $b$ is a linear
isomorphism $b : \R^n \to T_{\pi(b)}M$. Then given $v \in T_bP$, we
define the action of $\theta$ by
\[
 \theta_p(v) = b\inv(d\pi_p(v))
\]
The soldering form in some sense remembers that $\B(M)$ is the bundle of
frames. Then given a connection $\Theta \in \Omega_P^1(\gl_n\R)$ on $\B(M)$,
we use the $\Theta$ to define special vector fields on $P$, which we
denote $\partial_i$.\footnote{Note that these vector fields are not coordinate
 vector fields, though we have in the past used the notation $\partial_i$ to
 denote coordinate vector fields.} Given $b \in P$, we define $\partial_i\vert_b$
by $\partial_i\vert_b = \widetilde{b(e_1)}$, where $e_1$ denotes the first
standard basis vector of $\R^n$ and $\widetilde{b(e_1)}$ is the unique horizontal
lift of $b(e_1) \in T_{\pi(b)}M$ at $b$ with respect to the connection $\Theta$.
The vector fields $\partial_2, \ldots \partial_n$ are defined analogously,
and together the $\partial_i$ give a framing for the horizontal distribution on
$\B(M)$. The connection $\Theta$ on $\B(M)$ induces a covariant derivative $\nabla$
on any associated vector bundle $E \to M$, which has a very special relationship
with the vector fields $\partial_i$.
%
\begin{prop}
 Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\pi : \B(M) \to M$ its $GL_n\R$ bundle
 of frames. Equip $\B(M)$ with a connection $\Theta$ and define the vector fields
 $\partial_i$ as above. Then given a vector space $W$ with a representation
 $\rho : GL_n\R \to GL(W)$ let $E \to M$ denote the associated bundle, and
 let $\nabla$ denote the covariant derivative on $E$ induced by $\Theta$. Then
 given a section $\psi \in \Omega_M^0(E)$, it has a corresponding
 $GL_n\R$-equivariant map $\tilde{\psi} : P \to W$. Then the covariant derivative
 of $\tilde{\psi}$ is given by the formula
 \[
  \nabla\tilde{\psi} = \partial_i\tilde{\psi} \otimes e^i
 \]
 where $e^i \in (\R^n)^*$ denotes the dual basis to the standard basis $e_i$.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
 We first make sense of the formula. The covariant derivative $\nabla\psi$ is
 an element of $\Omega_M^1(E)$, which is a section of the bundle $E \otimes T^*M$.
 The bundle $T^*M$ is naturally isomorphic to the associated bundle
 $\B(M) \times_{GL_n\R} (\R^n)^*$ given by the dual to the standard representation
 of $GL_n\R$ on $\R^n$. Therefore, we get a representation of $GL_n\R$ on
 $W \otimes (\R^n)^*$, and $E \otimes T^*M$ is naturally isomorphic to the vector
 bundle $\B(M) \times_{GL_n\R} (W \otimes (\R^n)^*)$. Sections of this bundle
 are equivalent $GL_n\R$-equivariant maps $P \to W \otimes (\R^n)^*$. The action
 of the $\partial_i$ on $\tilde{\psi}$ produces $GL_n\R$-equivariant maps
 $\partial_i\psi : P \to W$, so the tensor product
 $\partial_i\tilde{\psi} \otimes e^i$ then defines a section of $E \otimes T^*M$. \\

 We then want to verify that this formula is true. Fix $x \in X$, $v \in T_xM$,
 and $b \in \pi\inv(x)$. The element $b$ determines a basis $b(e_1), \ldots b(e_n)$
 for $T_xM$. In this basis, $v$ has the representation $v^ib(e_i)$. Each
 of the $b(e_i)$ lift to $\partial_i\vert_b$, so the horizontal lift of $v$ to $b$
 is $v^i\partial_i\vert_b$. Then let
 $\tilde{\gamma} : (-\varepsilon, \varepsilon) \to P$ be an integral curve of
 $v^i\partial_i$. Then $\gamma = \pi \circ \tilde{\gamma}$ is a curve in $M$
 with $\gamma'(0) = v$, so the covariant derivative $(\nabla\tilde{\psi})_b(v)$ is
 given by
 \begin{align*}
  (\nabla\tilde{\psi})_b(v) & = \frac{d}{dt}\bigg\vert_{t=0}
  \tilde{\psi}(\tilde{\gamma}(t)) \\
                            & = v^i\partial_i\tilde{\psi}
 \end{align*}
 Therefore, $\nabla\psi = \partial_i \otimes e^i$.
\end{proof}
%
The vector fields $\partial_i$ on $\B(M)$ also give a recipe for constructing
differential operators between sections of associated vector bundles,
and we will use this recipe to construct a Dirac operator on a general Spin
manifold. Let $A$ and $B$ be linear representations of $GL_n\R$, and let
$E,F \to M$ be their associated vector bundles. The action of $GL_n\R$ on
$A$ and $B$ induces an action on $\hom(A,B)$, giving it the structure
of a $GL_n\R$ representation. Then given a $GL_n\R$-equivariant map
$\sigma : (\R^n)^* \to \hom(A,B)$, we can define a first order differential
operator
\begin{align*}
 D_\sigma : \Gamma_M(E) & \to \Gamma_M(F)                       \\
 \psi                   & \mapsto [\sigma(e^k)](\partial_k\psi)
\end{align*}
Where we interpret $\psi$ as a $GL_n\R$-equivariant map $P \to A$.
%
This method for constructing differential operator has already manifested itself
in several differential operators we have discussed.
%
\begin{exmp}
 Given a vector space $W$ with a $GL_n\R$ action, which gives an associated
 bundle $\B(M) \times_{GL_n\R} W$. A connection on $\B(M)$ induces a
 covariant derivative operator $\nabla$ on sections of the associated bundle.
 In terms of the horizontal vector
 fields $\partial_i$ defined on $\B(M)$, $\nabla$ is given by
 \[
  \nabla\psi = \partial_k\psi \otimes e^k
 \]
 Let $T : (R^n)^* \to \hom((\R^n)^*, W)$ be the map where $T(v)(w) = w \otimes v$.
 Then $\nabla = T(e^k)\partial_k$
\end{exmp}
%
\begin{exmp}
 Consider $\Lambda^k(\R^n)^*$ and $\Lambda^{k+1}(\R^n)^*$, which have a natural
 $GL_n\R$ action, and let
 $\varepsilon : (\R^n)^* \to \hom(\Lambda^k(\R^n)^,\Lambda^{k+1}(\R^n)^*)$
 be the exterior multiplication map, i.e.
 \[
  \varepsilon(v)(w) = v \wedge w
 \]
 This map is easily seen to be $GL_n\R$-equivariant. Using our recipe, we get a
 differential operator
 \begin{align*}
  D_\varepsilon : \Omega^k_M & \to \Omega^{k+1}_M                         \\
  \psi                       & \mapsto [\varepsilon(e^k)](\partial_k\psi)
 \end{align*}
 which is the de Rham differential $d$.
 %TODO Prove this.
\end{exmp}
%
The preceding discussion was all done with $\B(M)$ and $G = GL_n\R$, but the
discussion applies to any principal bundle $P$ with a reduction of structure
group to $\B(M)$, like $\B_O(M)$, $\B_{SO}(M)$, and $\B_{\Spin}(M)$. \\
%

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. The Riemannian metric $G$ gives a
reduction of structure group to $O_n$, giving us the orthonormal frame bundle
$\B_O(M)$. It is a wonderful fact that we have a canonical choice of connection
on $\B_O(M)$, where we ask for a quantity called the torsion tensor to vanish.
%
\begin{thm}[\ib{Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry}]
 There exists a unique torsion-free connection $\Theta$ on $\B_O(M)$.
\end{thm}
We call this connection the \ib{Levi-Civita connection}. If in addition,
$M$ is oriented, we have a reduction of structure group to $\B_{SO}(M$), and
the Levi-Civita connection restricts to this bundle. We also refer to this
connection as the Levi-Civita connection. Going further, if $M$ is Spin,
we get a canonical choice of connection on $\B_{\Spin}(M)$.
%
\begin{defn}
 Let $(M,g)$ be a Spin manifold, and let $\Theta$ be the Levi-Civita connection
 on the oriented orthonormal frame bundle $\B_{SO}(M)$. The double cover
 $\pi : \B_{\Spin} \to \B_{SO}(M)$ gives a natural isomorphism
 \[
  T(\B_{\Spin}(M)) \to \pi^*(T\B_{SO}(M))
 \]
 So the pullback of the horizontal distribution $H$ determined by $\Theta$
 defines a connection on $\B_{\Spin}(M)$ called the \ib{Spin connection}.
\end{defn}
%
We saw in $\R^n$ that the Dirac operator $D$ acted on functions
$\psi \in C^\infty(\R^n, V)$ for a Clifford module $V$. Over a manifold $M$,
these Clifford modules might vary over each point of the manifold, so the
Dirac operator should act on sections $\Gamma_M(\S)$ for some bundle $\S \to M$
of Clifford modules over $M$. \\
%

While we have discussed Spin structures extensively, and Dirac operators are
of particular importance to Spin geometry, they are not dependent on a Spin structure.
Note that the Dirac operator we defined on $\R^n$ only required a nondegenerate
bilinear form, which we used to construct the Clifford algebra. This suggests
that the only structure necessary to define a Dirac operator is a Riemannian metric.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $(M,g)$ be an oriented Riemannian manifold, giving us a reduction of structure
group $\B_{SO}(M) \to \B(M)$. Under the standard representation, $SO_n$ acts on $\R^n$
with the standard inner product by isometries, so every element $A \in SO_n$ induces
an algebra automorphism  $\rho_A : \Cliff_{n,0}(\R) \to \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$, giving
$\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ the structure of a $SO_n$ representation. The \ib{Clifford bundle}
of $M$ is the associated vector bundle
\[
\Cliff(M) = \B_{SO}(M) \times_{SO_n} \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)
\]
\end{defn}
%
In fact, the bundle $\Cliff(M) \to M$ is a bundle of Clifford algebras over $M$, where
over each point $p \in M$, the fiber $\Cliff(M)_p$ is $\Cliff(T_pM, g_p)$. Working
fiberwise, the natural vector space isomorphism
$\Cliff(T_pM, g_p) \to \Lambda^\bullet(T_pM,)$ determines  a vector bundle isomorphism
$\Cliff(M) \to \Lambda^\bullet(TM)$. Using the Riemannian metric, we get an isomorphism
$TM \to T^*M$, and the composition of these isomorphisms determines a vector bundle
isomorphism $\Cliff(M) \to \Lambda^\bullet(T^*M)$. In the case that the manifold
$M$ admits a Spin structure, we can define further bundles.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $(M,g)$ be an oriented Riemannian manifold equipped with a Spin structure
$\B_{\Spin}(M) \to \B_{SO}(M)$, and let $\S$ be a left Clifford module over
$\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$. The inclusion $\Spin_n \hookrightarrow \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ gives $\M$
the structure of a $\Spin_n$ representation. A \ib{spinor bundle} over $\M$ is the
associated vector bundle
\[
\B_\Spin(M) \times{\Spin_n} \S
\]
\end{defn}
%
As one would expect, there is an intimate relationship between the Clifford bundle
and a Spinor bundle over a Spin manifold. Namely, a spinor bundle $\S$ is a
bundle of left Clifford modules over $\Cliff(M)$, i.e. each fiber $\S_p$ is a left
Clifford module over the corresponding fiber $\Cliff(M)_p$. In addition, the
Levi-Civita and Spin connections induce canonical connections on $\Cliff(M)$ and
any spinor bundle $\S$. This gives us the ingredients to define a general
Dirac operator. \\
%

Equip $\R^n$ with the standard inner product, and let
$b :(\R^n)^* \times (\R^n)^* \to \R$ be the induced inner product on $(\R^n)^*$.
Using the double cover $\Spin_n \to SO_n$, the group $\Spin_n$ acts on
$(\R^n)^*$ through the dual representation of $SO_n$ on $(\R^n)^*$. In addition,
$\Spin_n$ acts naturally on any Clifford module $\S$ by left multiplication, where
we think of $\Spin_n$ as a subgroup of the group of units
$\Cliff((\R^n)^*, b)^\times$. The \ib{Clifford multiplication map}
$c : (\R^n)^* \to \End(\S))$ given by $c(v) = va$ is easily
verified to be $\Spin_n$-equivariant, so we can apply our recipe for
constructing differential operators to construct the Dirac operator.
%
\begin{defn}
 Let $(M,g)$ be a oriented Riemannian manifold equipped with a Spin structure
 $\varphi : \B_{\Spin}(M) \to \B_{SO}(M)$ and spinor bundle $\S \to M$.
 Using the Spin connection on $\B_{\Spin}(M)$, define the horizontal
 vector fields $\partial_i$ on $\B_{\Spin}(M)$ by
 \[
  \partial_i\vert_p = \widetilde{\varphi(p)(e_i)}
 \]
 where $\widetilde{\varphi(p)(e_i)}$ denotes the horizontal lift of the
 image of $e_i$ under $\varphi(p) \in \B_{SO}(M)$ to $T(\B_{\Spin}(M))$.
 The \ib{Dirac operator} is the first order differential operator
 \begin{align*}
  D : \Gamma_M(\S) & \to \Gamma_M(\S)          \\
  \psi                & \mapsto c(e^k)\partial_k\psi
 \end{align*}
 where we interpret $\psi$ as a $\Spin_n$-equivariant map
 $\B_{\Spin}(M) \to \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$.
\end{defn}
Note that this agrees with our previous definitions of Dirac operators on $\R^n$,
as well as the ones we defined on $S^1$. \\
%

A special spinor bundle to consider over a Spin manifold $M$ is when the Clifford
module is $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ itself, giving us a spinor bundle
\[
\S(M) = \B_{\Spin_n} \times_{\Spin_n} \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)
\]
The Clifford algebra $\Cliff_{n,0}$ is also a \emph{right} Clifford module over
itself, and this action commutes with the $\Spin_n$ action on the left. Therefore,
the right action of $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ on $\B_{\Spin}(M) \times \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$
descends to a right action on $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ on $\S(M)$, giving each fiber
the structure of a right Clifford module. In addition, the space of sections
$\Gamma_M(\S(M))$ of $\S(M)$ also inherit the structure of a Clifford module.
This right action commutes with Clifford  multiplication, so Clifford multiplication is
$\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ linear. Therefore, the Dirac operator defines a $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$
linear map $\Gamma_M(\S(M)) \to \Gamma_M(\S(M))$.

%
\begin{defn}
 Let $(M,g)$ be an oriented Riemannian manifold equipped with a Spin structure.
 The Clifford algebra $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ comes equipped with a natural left
 action of $\Spin_n \subset \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ given by left multiplication by
 $\Spin_n \subset \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$. Then the \ib{Spinor bundle} $\S(M) \to M$ is
 defined as the associated bundle $\B_{\Spin}(M) \times_{\Spin_n} \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$,
 which is a vector bundle with model fiber $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$.
\end{defn}
%
The product $\B_{\Spin} \times \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ admits a free right action of
$\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ given by right multiplication on the second factor. This
commutes with left multiplication on $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$, so this descends to a
free right action of $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ on the fibers of $\S(M) \to M$, giving
each fiber the structure of a right $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ module. \\
%

Equip $\R^n$ with the standard inner product, and let
$b :(\R^n)^* \times (\R^n)^* \to \R$ be the induced inner product on $(\R^n)^*$.
Using the double cover $\Spin_n \to SO_n$, the group $\Spin_n$ acts on
$(\R^n)^*$ through the dual representation of $SO_n$ on $(\R^n)^*$. In addition,
$\Spin_n$ acts naturally on $\Cliff((\R^n)^*, b)$ by left multiplication, where
we think of $\Spin_n$ as a subgroup of the group of units
$\Cliff((\R^n)^*, b)^\times$. The \ib{Clifford multiplication map}
$c : (\R^n)^* \to \Aut(\Cliff((\R^n)^*, b))$ given by $c(v) = va$ is easily
verified to be $\Spin_n$-equivariant, so we can apply our recipe for
constructing differential operators to construct the Dirac operator.
%
\begin{defn}
 Let $(M,g)$ be a oriented Riemannian manifold equipped with a Spin structure
 $\varphi : \B_{\Spin}(M) \to \B_{SO}(M)$ and spinor bundle $\S(M) \to M$.
 Using the Spin connection on $\B_{\Spin}(M)$, define the horizontal
 vector fields $\partial_i$ on $\B_{\Spin}(M)$ by
 \[
  \partial_i\vert_p = \widetilde{\varphi(p)(e_i)}
 \]
 where $\widetilde{\varphi(p)(e_i)}$ denotes the horizontal lift of the
 image of $e_i$ under $\varphi(p) \in \B_{SO}(M)$ to $T(\B_{\Spin}(M))$.
 The \ib{Dirac operator} is the first order differential operator
 \begin{align*}
  D : \Gamma_M(\S(M)) & \to \Gamma_M(\S(M))          \\
  \psi                & \mapsto c(e^k)\partial_k\psi
 \end{align*}
 where we interpret $\psi$ as a $\Spin_n$-equivariant map
 $\B_{\Spin}(M) \to \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$.
\end{defn}
%
Note that this agrees with our previous definitions of Dirac operators on $\R^n$,
as well as the ones we defined on $S^1$.
