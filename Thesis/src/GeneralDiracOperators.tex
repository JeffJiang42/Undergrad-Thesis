\section{Dirac Operators on Manifolds}
%
We saw in $\R^n$ that the Dirac operator $D$ acted on functions
$\psi \in C^\infty(\R^n, V)$ for a Clifford module $V$. Over a manifold $M$,
these Clifford modules might vary over each point of the manifold, so the
Dirac operator should act on sections $\Gamma_M(S)$ for some bundle $S \to M$
of Clifford modules over $M$.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $(M,g)$ be an oriented Riemannian manifold equipped with a Spin structure,
and let $\B_\Spin(M) \to M$ denote the principal $\Spin_n$-bundle over $M$.
The Clifford algebra $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ comes equipped with a natural left
action of $\Spin_n \subset \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ given by left multiplication by
$\Spin_n \subset \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$. Then the \ib{Spinor bundle} $S(M) \to M$ is
the associated bundle $\B_{\Spin}(M) \times_{\Spin_n} \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$,
which is a vector bundle with model fiber $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$.
\end{defn}
%
The product $\B_{\Spin} \times \Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ admits a free right action of
$\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ given by right multiplication on the second factor. This
commutes with left multiplication on $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$, so this descends to a
free right action of $\Cliff_{n,0}(\R)$ on the fibers of $S(M) \to M$.
