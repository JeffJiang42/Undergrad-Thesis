\section{$\Pin^\pm_n$ Structures}
%
The same general construction for Spin structures works for $\Pin^\pm_n$ as well.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. Then a \ib{$\Pin_n^\pm$ structure} on $M$ is the
data of a principal $\Pin_n^\pm$-bundle $P \to M$, along with a
$\Pin^\pm_n$-equivariant map $P \to \B_O(M)$, where the $\Pin^\pm_n$ action on
$\B_O(M)$ is given by the double cover $\Pin^\pm_n \to O_n$.
\end{defn}
%
Just like with Spin, a $\Pin^\pm_n$ structure on $M$ induces a $\Pin^\pm_{n-1}$
on the boundary using the outward unit normal, which gives the analogous diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\B_{\Pin^\pm}(\partial M) \ar[d]\ar[r, hookrightarrow] & \B_{\Pin^\pm}(M)\vert_{\partial M}
\ar[d]\ar[r, hookrightarrow] & \B_{\Pin^\pm}(M) \ar[d]\\
\B_O(\partial M) \ar[dr]\ar[r, hookrightarrow] & \B_O(M)\vert_{\partial M}
\ar[d]\ar[r, hookrightarrow] & \B_O(M) \ar[d]\\
& \partial M \ar[r, hookrightarrow]& M
\end{tikzcd}\]

\begin{exmp}[Pin structures on $S^1$] %TODO FIX THIS
There are two problems to discuss here, since $\Pin_1^+$ and $\Pin_1^-$ are
different groups, namely
%
\begin{align*}
\Pin_1^+ &\cong \Z/2\Z \times \Z / 2\Z \\
\Pin_1^- &\cong \Z/4\Z
\end{align*}
%
We do the $\Pin_1^+$ case first. In this case, the Clifford algebra
$\Cliff_{1,0}(\R)$ is isomorphic to $\R \times \R$, where the isomorphism is
determined by $e_1 \mapsto (-1,1)$. There are two irreducible modules corresponding
to projection onto one of the factors, so the Pinor representations are the one
dimensional real representations $\P^+$ and $\P^-$, where the action of $e_1$ on
$\P^\pm$ is by $\pm 1$. Let $\P = \P^+ \oplus \P^-$. We then take inventory
of all the principal $\Pin_1^+$-bundles over $S^1$. From before, we know that these
are classified by homomorphisms $\pi_1(S^1, \theta_0) \to \Pin_1^+$ up to
conjugation. Since $\Pin_1^+$ is abelian, the conjugation action is trivial,
so principal $\Pin_1^+$-bundles are classified by homomorphisms
$\pi_1(S^1,\theta_0) \to \Pin_1^+$. There are $4$ such homomorphisms,
which are all determined by the image of a generator $\alpha$ of $
\pi_1(S^1,\theta_0)$, since the fundamental group is infinite cyclic. The bundle
corresponding to the map $\alpha \mapsto 1$ is has $4$ connected components,
each mapped onto diffeomorphically onto $S^1$, and the action of $\Pin_1^+$
permutes these $4$ components. All the $\Pin_1^+$ bundles are diffeomorphic
to two disjoint circles that both cover the circle via the map $z \mapsto z^2$,
and are differentiated by the action of $\Pin_1^+$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For the bundle corresponding to the homomorphism mapping
  $\alpha \mapsto -1$, the element $-1$ acts by rotating both circles by $\pi$,
  and the element $e_1$ exchanges the two circles.
  \item For the bundle corresponding to $\alpha \mapsto e_1$, we then have that
  $e_1$ rotates both circles by $\pi$, and $-1$ exchanges the two circles.
  \item For the bundle corresponding to $\alpha \mapsto -e_1$, the element
  $-e_1$ acts by rotation by $\pi$, and the element $-1$ exchanges the two
  circles.
\end{enumerate}
%
We denote all the bundles $P_g$, where $g$ is the image of $\alpha$ under
the corresponding homomorphism. We then must determine which bundles admit
$\Pin_1^+$-equivariant maps $P_g \to \B_O(S^1)$, which is a pair of disjoint
circles permuted by $O_1 = \set{\pm 1}$. Under the double covering, the
elements $\pm 1$ act trivially, while the elements $\pm e_1$ act by $-1$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The bundle $P_1 \to S^1$ admits a $\Pin_1^+$-equivariant map
  $P_1 \to \B_O(S^1)$. After mapping one of the components diffeomorphically
  onto one of the components of $\B_O(S^1)$, we know how to map
  the other $3$ components to make the map $\Pin_1^+$-equivariant.
  \item The bundle $P_{-1} \to S^1$ can also define a $\Pin_1^+$ structure on
  $S^1$. Since $-1$ rotates both circles by $\pi$, we map each component to
  a componenet of $\B_O(S^1)$ via the double cover $z \mapsto z^2$.
  \item The bundle $P_{e_1} \to S^1$ cannot determine a $\Pin^+_1$ structure.
  The action of $e_1$ rotates both components of $P_{e_1}$ by $\pi$, but
  permutes the components of $\B_O(S^1)$. Any $\Pin_1^+$-equivariant map
  $P_{e_1} \to \B_O(S^1)$ must map one component of $P_{e_1}$ onto two
  components of $\B_O(S^1)$, which is impossible
  \item The bundle $P_{-e_1} \to S^1$ also cannot determine a $\Pin_1^+$
  stucture by the same reason that $P_{e_1}$ cannot.
\end{enumerate}
%
One thing to note is that an orientation of $S^1$ and a $\Pin_1^+$ structure
on $S^1$ determine a Spin structure. A choice of component of $\B_O(S^1)$
determines an orientation, and taking the preimage of that component
under the maps $P_{\pm 1} \to \B_O(S^1)$, we recover a Spin structure. In
particular, the bundle $P_1$ corresponds to the Spin structure with Dirac operator
$i\partial_\theta$ and the bundle $P_{-1}$ corresponds to the Spin structure
with Dirac operator $i\partial_\theta - \frac{1}{2}$.  Indeed, the associated
bundles $P_{\pm 1} \times_{\Pin_1^+} \P$ have the same Dirac operators. \\

For the case of $\Pin_1^-$, there are again $4$ different principal $\Pin_1^-$
bundles, classified by homomorphisms $\pi_1(S^1, \theta_0) \to \Pin_1^-$.
As before, we let $\alpha$ denote a generator for $\pi_1(S^1, \theta_0)$, and
let $P_g \to S^1$ denote the principal $\Pin_1^-$ bundle corresponding to
the homomorphism mapping $\alpha \mapsto g$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The bundle $P_1 \to S^1$ has $4$ components cyclically permuted
  by the action of $e_1$.
  \item The bundle $P_{-1} \to S^1$ has $2$ components, both double covering $S^1$.
  the element $-1$ acts by rotation by $\pi$ on both factors, and the action
  of $e_1$ permutes the two components.
  \item The bundle $P_{e_1} \to S^1$ corresponds to the $4$-fold covering
  $S^1 \to S^1$ given by $z \mapsto z^4$. The action of $e_1$ acts by
  roation by $\pi / 2$.
  \item The bundle $P_{-e_1} \to S^1$ also corresponds to a $4$-fold covering,
  where the action of $-e_1$ is given by rotation by $\pi / 2$.
\end{enumerate}
%
Again, we need to figure out which bundles can determine $\Pin_1^-$ structures
on $S^1$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The bundle $P_1$ admits a map $P_1 \to \B_O(S^1)$. After mapping any
  component diffeomorphically onto a component of $\B_O(S^1)$, the rest of the
  map is determined.
  \item The bundle $P_{-1}$ admits a map $P_{-1} \to \B_O(S^1)$, where
  each component maps onto a component of $\B_O(S^1)$ via the double cover
  $z \mapsto z^2$.
  \item This bundle cannot determine a $\Pin_1^-$ structure, since there
  cannot exist a continuous surjective map from a connected space to a
  disconnected space.
  \item This bundle cannot determine a $\Pin_1^-$ structure by the same
  reasoning as above.
\end{enumerate}
Again, we see that the $\Pin_1^-$ stuctures on $S^1$ correspond to $\Spin$
stuctures once we fix an orientation, and the associated bundles to these
$\Pin_1^-$-bundles will have the same Dirac operator.
\end{exmp}
%
On the circle, we observed that a $\Pin^\pm$ structure and and orientation
are equivalent data to a Spin structure. This is true in general via the same
construction. A $\Pin^\pm$ structure is the data of a principal
$\Pin^\pm_n$-bundle $\B_{\Pin^\pm}(M) \to M$ along with a
$\Pin^\pm_n$-equivariant map $\B_{\Pin^\pm}(M) \to \B_O(M)$. An orientation
determines a subset $\B_{SO}(M) \subset \B_O(M)$ that is a principal
$SO_n$-bundle over $M$, and taking the preimage of $\B_{SO}(M)$ under the
map $\B_{\Pin^\pm}(M) \to \B_O(M)$ determines the desired Spin structure.
%
Unlike Spin structures, $\Pin^\pm$ structures do not require an orientation,
and can be defined on nonorientable manifolds.
%
\begin{exmp}[$\Pin^\pm$ structures on the M\"obius band]
Let $M$ denote the M\"obius band, which is the quotient space
\[
M = [-1,1] \times [-1,1] / (-1, x) \sim (1, -x)
\]
The square $S = [-1,1] \times [-1,1]$ inherits a Riemannian metric from $\R^2$,
and the orthonormal frame bundle $\B_O(S)$ is isomorphic to
the product $S \times O_2$. This the descends to $M$ after
we specify gluing data for the identified edges of the square. The identification
of the edges reverses the direction in the second factor, which corresponds to
a transformation by the matrix
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\]
Giving us that the orthonormal frame bundle $\B_O(M)$ of $M$ induced by the
metric on $S$ is isomorphic to
\[
S\times O_2 / (-1,x, b) \sim (1,-x, A \cdot b)
\]
We do the $\Pin^+_2$ case first. Inside of $\Cliff_{2,0} \cong M_2\R$,
the group $\Pin_2^+$ is topologically two disjoint circles. The identity component
is \[
\Spin_2 = \set{\cos\theta + \sin\theta e_1e_2 ~:~ \theta \in \R}
\]
and the second component is the subset $e_1 \cdot \Spin_2$. The square
$S$ admits a single principal $\Pin_2^+$-bundle, which is the trivial bundle
$S \times \Pin_2^+$, and any principal $\Pin_2^+$-bundle over $M$ will come
by specifying gluing data of $S \times \Pin_2^+$ on the identified edges of $S$.
More explicitly, any principal $\Pin_2^+$-bundle over $M$ will arise as a
quotient
\[
S \times \Pin_2^+ / (-1,x,g) \sim (1, -x, \psi(g))
\]
Where $\psi : \Pin_2^+ \to \Pin_2^+$ is a $\Pin_2^+$-equivariant diffeomorphism.
From this characterization, we can determine which maps $\psi$ determine
a principal $\Pin^+_2$-bundle $P \to M$ that admit a $\Pin_2^+$-equivariant
map $P \to \B_O(M)$. For points that that are not identified, i.e. points
on $S$ with first component not equal to $\pm 1$, we can specify
$P \to \B_O(M)$ fiberwise by the standard double cover $\Pin_2^+ \to O_2$. On
the identified edges, in order for the map to be $\Pin_2^+$-equivariant, we
require that the image of the equivalence class $[-1,x,g] \in P$ to be
$[-1, x, \rho(g)]$, where $\rho : \Pin_2^+ \to O_2$ is the double cover. However,
we have that $[-1,x,g] = [1, -x, \psi(g)]$ and
$[-1,x,\rho(g)] = [1,-x, A \cdot \rho(g)]$, so we need $\psi(g)$ to be one
of the preimages of $A \cdot \rho(g)$ under the double cover in order for this
to be well defined. Since $A$ is an orthogonal transformation, it has two
preimages under the double cover, which is $\rho\inv(A) = \pm e_1$. Therefore,
$\psi$ must be left multiplication by either $\pm e_1$, giving us two
$\Pin^+$ structures on $M$.
