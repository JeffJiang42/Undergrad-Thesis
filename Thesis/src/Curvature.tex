\section{Curvature}
%
An important quantity associated to a connection is it's \ib{curvature}, which
heuristically measures its deviation from our standard notions of a directional
derivative. We first discuss curvature on principal bundles, and will then
explore its relationship with associated bundles.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a Lie group with Lie algebra $\g$, and $\pi : P \to M$ a principal $G$-bundle.
Let $\Theta \in \Omega_P^1(\g)$ be a connection on $P$. The \ib{curvature tensor} is
a $2$-form $\Omega \in \Omega_P^2(\g)$ defined by the equation
\[
\Omega = d\Theta + \frac{1}{2}[\Theta \wedge \Theta]
\]
where the action of $[\Theta \wedge \Theta]$ on $X$ is defined to be
\[
[\Theta \wedge \Theta](X) = [\Theta(X), \Theta(X)]
\]
\end{defn}
