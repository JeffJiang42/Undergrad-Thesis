\section{Connections}
%
We previously defined the Dirac operator $D$ on $\R^n$ and explored some
instances of $D$ in low dimensions. The constructions implicitly used the
Riemannian geometry on $\R^n$, along with its associated Spin structure.
To explore the Dirac operator in more generality on manifolds, we need to
develop some of the Riemannian geometry in the nonlinear world of manifolds.

%
\begin{defn}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A \ib{distribution} on $X$ is a vector subbundle
$E \subset TX$.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}
let $\pi : E \to M$ be a fiber bundle. The map $\pi$ determines a distinguished
subspace $\ker d\pi_e \subset T_eE$, called the \ib{vertical subspace}
which defines a distribution $V$ over $E$ called the \ib{vertical distribution}.
A \ib{connection} on $E$ is another distribution $H \subset TE$ such that
at every point $e \in E$, we have $V_e \oplus H_e = T_eE$. In other words,
it is a choice of splitting of the short exact sequence of vector bundles
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & V \ar[r] & TE \ar[r] & \pi^*TM \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
If $E$ is a principal $G$-bundle, we ask for the horizontal distribution $H$
to be $G$-invariant, i.e. $H_{p \cdot g} = d(R_g)_p(H_p)$, where $R_g : E \to E$
denotes the right action of $g \in G$.
\end{defn}
%TODO, connections exist?
Having defined a connection, we should check that such an object actually exists.
To show this, we first need a few lemmas.
%
\begin{defn}
Let
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r, "\varphi"] & B \ar[r, "\psi"] & C \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
be a short exact sequence of vector spaces. A \ib{splitting} of this
exact sequence is a map $i : C \to B$ such that $\varphi \circ i = \id_C$.
If a splitting exists, we say that the short exact sequence splits.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{prop}
Given a short exact sequence of vector spaces
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r, "\varphi"] & B \ar[r, "\psi"] & C \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
A splitting $i : C \to B$ is equivalent to a linear map $j : B \to A$ with
$\varphi \circ j = \id_B$.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof} %TODO
Let $i : C \to A$ be a splitting.
\end{proof}
%
A splitting $i : C \to B$ can be thought of as equivalent data to an isomorphism
$B \to A \oplus C$. Since the sequence is exact, the map $\varphi : A \to B$
is injective, so we can identify $A$ with its image $\varphi(A) \subset B$.
The splitting is also injective, giving an identification of $C$ with its
image $i(C)$. Since $i$ is a splitting, $\psi \circ i = \id_C$, which implies
that $i(C) \cap \ker\psi = \set{0}$, and since the sequence is exact,
$\ker\psi = \varphi(A)$. Therefore, the map
$\varphi \oplus i : A \oplus C \to B$ is injective, and by a dimension count,
it is an isomorphism.
%
\begin{lem}
Every short exact sequence of vector spaces
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r, "\varphi"] & B \ar[r, "\psi"] & C \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
splits.
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof}
We want to define a map $i : C \to B$ such that $\psi \circ i = \id_C$. Let
$\set{c_1, \ldots, c_n}$ be a basis for $C$. Since the sequence is exact,
the map $\psi : B \to C$ is surjective, so for each $c_i$, we can pick an element
$b_i \in B$ such that $\psi(b_i) = c_i$. Then define $i(c_i) = b_i$ and
extend $i$ to all of $i$, giving the desired splitting.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{lem}
The space of splittings of a short exact sequence
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r, "\varphi"] & B \ar[r, "\psi"] & C \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
is an affine space over $\hom(C,B)$,
i.e. the difference $i - j$ can be canonically identified with an element of
$\hom(C,A)$.
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof} % Finish the proof that it is affine?
Let $i,j : C \to B$ be splittings of the exact sequence, and let
$c \in C$. Then since $i$ and $j$ are splittings,
\[
\psi((i-j)(c)) = \psi(i(c)) - \psi(j(c)) = c - c = 0
\]
Therefore, $(i-j)(c) \in \ker\psi$, so by exactness, there exists an $a \in A$
such that $\varphi(a) = (i-j)(c)$. By exactness, we know $\varphi$ is injective,
so this $a$ is unique. Therefore, the mapping $c \mapsto \varphi\inv((i-j)(c))$
defines the desired linear map $C \to A$.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{prop}
Given a fiber bundle $\pi : E \to M$ with model fiber $F$, a connection
$H \subset TE$ exists.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
It suffices to show that the short exact sequence of vector bundles
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & V \ar[r] & TE \ar[r] & \pi^*TM \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
splits. Over any point $e \in E$, the space of splittings of
$0 \to V_e \to T_eE \to (\pi^*TM)_e$ is affine over the vector space
$\hom((\pi^*TM))_e \to V_e)$. Doing this fiberwise, we get a fiber bundle
$S \to E$ where the fiber over each $e \in E$ is the space of splittings
of the exact sequence, which can be seen by working in local trivializations.
Then let $\set{U_\alpha}$ be an open cover of $E$ equipped with local
trivializations $\varphi_\alpha$ of $S \to E$. The exact sequence
\[
0 \to V\vert_{\pi\inv(U_\alpha)} \to TE\vert_{\pi\inv(U_\alpha)} \to
\pi^*TM\vert_{\pi\inv(U_\alpha)}
\]
is modeled by the exact sequence $0 \to TF \to TU_\alpha \oplus TF \to TU_\alpha \to 0$,
which has a natural splitting given by the inclusion
$i_\alpha : TU_\alpha \hookrightarrow TU_\alpha \oplus TF$. The local trivialization
$\varphi_\alpha$ then allows us to transport this to a splitting over $U_\alpha$.
Then let $\set{\theta}$ be a partition of unity subordinate to $\set{U_\alpha}$.
Since the space of splittings is an affine space, it is closed under affine
combinations of splittings, so we can define a splitting
$i : \pi^*TM \to TE$ by $i = \sum_\alpha i_\alpha$.
\end{proof}
%TODO identification of vertical spaces with the Lie algebra.
%Discuss Lie algebra/exponential?
We are mostly concerned with connections on principal bundles, which have a
richer structure than connections on a general fiber bundle. Let $\pi : P \to M$
be a principal $G$-bundle, and let $\mathfrak{g}$ denote the Lie algebra of $G$.
Let $\exp : \g \to G$ denote the exponential map. Fix $x \in M$, a point
$p \in \pi\inv(x)$, and an element $X \in \g$. This determines a curve
$\gamma_X : I \to \pi\inv(x)$ with $\gamma_X(0) = p$ given by
\[
\gamma_X(t) = p \cdot \exp(tX)
\]
Since the action of $G$ preserves the fiber $\pi\inv(x)$, this curve lies
entirely in the fiber $\pi\inv(x)$, so the tangent vector $\dt{\gamma}_X$
at $t = 0$ is an element of the vertical space. In addition, since the
action of $G$ is free, the tangent vector $\dt{\gamma}_X = 0$ if and only if
$X = 0$, so the linear mapping $X \mapsto \dt{\gamma}_X$ is injective, and
consequently, an isomorphism $\g \to V_p$. Doing this on all points of $P$
then gives an isomorphism $\underline{\g} \to V$, where $\underline{\g}$ denotes
the trivial bundle $M \times \g$. Under this isomorphism, the exact
sequence of vector bundles becomes
\[\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & \underline{\g} \ar[r] & TE \ar[r] & \pi^*TM \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
