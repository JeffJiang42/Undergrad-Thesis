\section{Principal Bundles}
%
\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a Lie group, and $M$ a smooth manifold. A \ib{Principal } $G$\ib{-bundle}
over $M$ is the data of
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A smooth manifold $P$ with a map $\pi : P \to M$.
  \item A smooth right $G$-action on $P$ that is free an transitive on the fibers
  of $\pi$.
  \item For every point $p \in M$, a neighborhood $U \subset M$ of $p$ and
  a $G$-equivariant diffeomorphism $\pi\inv(U) \to U \times G$ (where the
  right action on $U \times G$ is right multiplication on the second factor)
  such that we get the commutative diagram
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
  \pi\inv(U) \ar[dr, "\pi"']\ar[rr, "\varphi"]&& U \times G \ar[dl, "p_U"]\\
  & U
  \end{tikzcd}\]
  where $p_U$ denotes projection onto the first factor.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
%
\begin{exmp}
Given a smooth manifold $M$ and a point $p \in M$, a basis of the
tangent space is a linear isomorphism $b : \R^n \to T_pM$. The group
$GL_n\R$ acts on the set of bases $\mathcal{B}_p$  on the right by
$b \cdot g = b \circ g$. Then the \ib{frame bundle} of $M$, denoted
$\mathcal{B}(M)$ is the disjoint union
\[
\mathcal{B}(M) = \coprod_{p \in M}\mathcal{B}_p
\]
where $\pi$ denotes the projection $(p,b) \mapsto p$. Then $\mathcal{B}(M)$
is a principal $GL_n\R$ bundle over $M$.
\end{exmp}
%
\begin{exmp}
Given a smooth manifold $M$ with a Riemannian metric $g$, this induces an inner
product on each tangent space. Then the set of orthonormal bases of $T_pM$ is the
set of all linear isometries $T_pM \to \R^n$, where $\R^n$ is equipped with the
standard inner product. Then the disjoint union over all points $p$ of
orthonormal bases for the tangent spaces forms the \ib{orthonormal frame bundle}
$\mathcal{B}_O(M)$, which is a principal $O_n$ bundle.
\end{exmp}
%
\begin{defn}
Let $\pi : P \to m$ be a principal $G$-bundle over $M$, and let $F$ be a
smooth manifold with a smooth left $G$ action. Then the \ib{associated fiber
bundle}, denoted $P \times_G F$, is the set
\[
P \times_G F = P \times G / (p,g) \sim (p\cdot h, h\inv g)
\]
\end{defn}
