\emph{No one fully understands spinors. Their algebra is formally understood,
but their geometrical significance is mysterious. In some sense they describe
the ``square root" of geometry and, just as understanding the concept of
$\sqrt{-1}$ took centuries, the same might be true of spinors.} \\

\section{Clifford Algebras}
%
\begin{defn}
Let $V$ be a real finite dimensional vector space with a nondegenerate
symmetric bilinear form $b : V \times V \to \R$. Then the \ib{Clifford Algebra}
of $V$ is the data of a unital associative $\R$-algebra $\Cliff(V,b)$ and a linear
map $i : V \to \Cliff(V,b)$ satisfying the following universal property:
Given any linear map $\varphi : V \to A$ of $V$ into any unital associative
$\R$-algebra $A$ satisfying $\varphi(v)^2 = b(v,v)$, there exists a unique map
$\tilde{\varphi}: \Cliff(V,b) \to A$ such that the following diagram commutes:
%
\[\begin{tikzcd}
V \ar[dr, "\varphi"] \ar[d, "i"'] \\
\Cliff(V,b) \ar[r, "\tilde{\varphi}"'] & A
\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{defn}
%
Explicitly, we can construct $\Cliff(V,b)$ as a quotient of the tensor algebra
\[
\mathcal{T}(V) = \bigoplus_{n \in \Z^{\geq 0}} V^{\otimes n}
\]
where we quotient by the left ideal generated by elements of the form
$v \otimes v - b(v,v)$, and the linear map
$i: V \to \mathcal{T}(V) / (v \otimes v - b(v,v))$
is given by the inclusion $V \hookrightarrow \mathcal{T}(V)$ followed by the
quotient map. We identify $V$ with its image $i(V)$ as a subspace of $\Cliff(V,b)$.
%
\begin{defn}
Define the bilinear form $b : \R^{p+q} \times \R^{p+q} \to \R$ by
\[
b(v,w) = \sum_{i = 1}^{p} v^iw^i - \sum_{i = p+1}^{p+1} v^iw^i
\]
where the $v^i$ and $w^i$ are the components of $v$ and $w$ with respect to
the standard basis on $\R^{p+q}$. We denote the vector space $\R^{p+q}$
equipped with this bilinear form as $\R^{p,q}$.
\end{defn}
%
Let $V$ be a vector space equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form $b$ and
fix a basis for $V$. Then the bilinear form $b$ is given by a symmetric
invertible matrix $B$, which is conjugate to a diagonal matrix where all
the diagonal entries are either $1$ or $-1$. If after conjugation $B$ has
$p$ positive entries and $q$ negative entries, we say $b$ has signature $(p,q)$.
Any bilinear form $b$ of signature $(p,q)$ admits a basis $\set{e_i}$ satisfying
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For $1 \leq i \leq p$, we have $b(e_i,e_i) = 1$
  \item For $p+1 \leq j \leq p+q$, we have $b(e_j,e_j) = -1$
  \item For $i \neq j$, we have $b(e_i,e_j) = 0$
\end{enumerate}
%
Any such basis then determines an isomorphism $(V,b) \to \R^{p,q}$.
In addition, we get a basis for $\Cliff(V,b)$, given by
\[
\set{e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\cdots e_{i_k}~:~ 0 \leq k \leq n, ~ 1 \leq i_j \leq n}
\]
where we interpret the product of $0$ basis vectors to be the unit element $1$.
This then implies the dimension of $\Cliff(V,b)$ as a vector space is
$2^{\dim V}$. This basis also determines an isomorphism
$\Cliff(V,b) \to \Cliff_{p,q}(\R)$, where $\Cliff_{p,q}(\R)$ is the Clifford
algebra for $\R^{p,q}$. Given $v,w \in V$, we write $v$ and $w$ in these
bases as $v^ie_i$ and $w^ie_i$ (using Einstein summation convention),
and derive the useful relation
%
\begin{align*}
vw + wv &= v^iw^je_ie_j + v^iw^je_je_i \\
&= v^iw^i(e_i^2 + e_i^2) \\
&= 2b(v,w)
\end{align*}
where we use the fact that the $e_i$ are orthgonal to deduce that $e_ie_j = -e_je_i$
if $i \neq j$.
%
\begin{defn}\footnote{It is common in the literature to refer to $\Z/2\Z$
graded vector spaces as super vector spaces. The ``super" prefix often refers
to a $\Z/2\Z$ grading on the relevant object.}
Let $V$ be a vector space. A $\Z /2\Z$ \ib{grading} on $V$ is a decomposition
$V = V^0 \oplus V^1$. Equivalently, it is the data of a linear map
$\varepsilon : V \to V$ such that $\varepsilon$ acts by identity on a subspace $V^0$
of $V$ and negative identity on a complementary subspace $V^1$, which gives us the
desired direct sum decomposition of $V$ as the $\pm 1$ eigenspaces of $\varepsilon$.
The map $\varepsilon$ is called the \ib{grading operator}. Elements of $V^0$
are said to be \ib{even} and elements of $V^1$ are said to be \ib{odd}. Elements
of the even and odd subspaces are said to be \ib{homogeneous}. Given an homogeneous
element $v \in V$, define its \ib{parity}, denoted $|v|$ by
\[
|v| = \begin{cases}
0 & v \in V^0 \\
1 & v \in V^1
\end{cases}
\]
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}
A $\Z/2\Z$ \ib{graded algebra} $A$ over $\R$ (often called a superalgebra) is
an $\R$-algebra $A$ equipped with a grading $A = A^0 \oplus A^1$ such that
the multiplication respects the grading, i.e. given elements $a,b \in A$, Their
product $ab$ is an element of $A^{|a| + |b|}$ where the addition is done mod $2$.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{exmp}\enumbreak
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Any $\R$-algebra $A$ can be made into a graded algebra where we let
  $A^0 = A$ and $A^1 = 0$.
  \item The exterior algebra $\Lambda^\bullet V$ of a vector space $V$ is
  a $\Z/2\Z$ graded algebra (in fact, it is $\Z$ graded), where the grading is
  $\Lambda^\bullet V = \Lambda^0 V \oplus \Lambda^1 V$ where $\Lambda^0 V$
  is the subspace spanned by even products of vectors and $\Lambda^1 V$ is the
  subspace spanned by odd products of vectors.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exmp}
%
For the most part, the algebras we work with will be $\Z/2\Z$ graded, so
the term ``graded" may be used in lieu of ``$\Z/2\Z$ graded." In the case of
ambiguity, we will specify the grading. \\
The Clifford algebra $\Cliff(V,b)$ is naturally a $\Z/2\Z$ graded algebra. Fix
a basis $\set{e_i}$ for $\Cliff(V,b)$. We then define a grading
\[
\Cliff(V,b) = \Cliff^0(V,b) \oplus \Cliff^1(V,b)
\]
Where $\Cliff^0(V,b)$ is the $\R$-span of all even products of basis vectors,
and $\Cliff^1(V,b)$ is the $\R$-span of all odd products of basis vectors. In
particular, $\Cliff^0(V,b)$ forms a subalgebra, and is called the \ib{even
subalgebra}. There is an extremely nice relationship between a Clifford algebra
and its even subalgebra.
%
\begin{thm}
The even subalgebra $\Cliff_{p,q}^0(\R)$ is isomorphic to both $\Cliff_{q, p-1}$
and $\Cliff_{p,q-1}$ as ungraded algebras (as long as $p-1 > 0$ or $q-1 > 0$.)
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
Fix a basis $\set{e_1^+, \ldots e_p^+, e_1^- \ldots e_q^-}$ for $\R^{p,q}$, where
$(e_i^+)^2 = 1$ and $(e_i^-)^2 = -1$. Then a quick computation shows that
%
\begin{align*}
(e_i^+e_j^+)^2 &= -(e_i^+)^2(e_j^+)^2 = -1 \\
(e_i^-e_j^-)^2 &= -(e_i^-)^2(e_j^-)^2 = -1 \\
(e_i^+e_j^-)^2 &= -(e_i^+)^2(e_i^-)^2 = 1 \\
(e_i^-e_j^+)^2 &= -(e_i^-)^2(e_j^+)^2 = 1
\end{align*}
%
Assume $q \neq 0$. Then a generating set for $\Cliff_{p,q}^0(\R)$ is
\[
\set{e_1^-e_j^+ ~:~ 1 \leq j \leq p} \cup \set{e_1^-e_k^- ~:~ 2 \leq k \leq q}
\]
All the elements in the first set square to $1$, and all the elements in the
second set square to $-1$. We then get an isomorphism
$\Cliff^0_{p,q}(\R) \to \Cliff_{p,q-1}$ via the mappings
\begin{align*}
e_1^-e_j^+ &\mapsto e_j^+ \\
e_1^-e_k^- &\mapsto e_{k-1}^-
\end{align*}
In the case where $p \neq 0$, we have that an equally good generating set for
$\Cliff_{p,q}^0(\R)$ is
\[
\set{e^+_1e_j^+ ~:~ 2 \leq j \leq p} \cup \set{e_1^+e_i^- ~:~ 1 \leq i \leq q}
\]
Where the elements in the first set square to $-1$ and the elements of the second
set square to $1$. Then the mappings
\begin{align*}
e_1^+e_j^+ &\mapsto e_{j-1}^- \\
e_1^+e_j^- &\mapsto e_j^+
\end{align*}
gives the isomorphism $\Cliff_{p,q}^0(\R) \to \Cliff_{q, p-1}$.
\end{proof}
%
Given two $\R$-algebras $A$ and $B$, we can form their tensor product
$A \otimes B$, which has $A \otimes B$ as the underlying vector space, and the
multiplication is defined as
\[
(a \otimes b)(c \otimes d) = ac \otimes bd
\]
In the case that both $A$ and $B$ are $\Z/2\Z$ graded algebras, we have an alternate
version of the tensor product, where the underlying vector space is also
$A \otimes B$, but the multiplication is given by
\[
(a \otimes b)(c \otimes d) = (-1)^{|b||c|}(ac \otimes bd)
\]
We see that in the multiplication, we are formally commuting the elements of
$b$ and $c$, and we want to introduce a sign whenever elements are moved past
each other. This is the \ib{Koszul sign rule}. Another concept that needs
a slight modification in the graded case is the opposite algebra. In the
normal case, given an $\R$-algebra $A$, the \ib{opposite algebra} is
the algebra $A^{\text{op}}$ with the same underlying vector space, but
the multiplication in $A^\text{op}$ is given by $a * b = ba$, where $ba$
is the multiplication in $A$. In doing so, we are formally commuting $a$
and $b$, so in the graded situation, we invoke the Koszul sign rule when
defining the opposite algebra, and define the multiplication in $A^{\text{op}}$
to be $a * b = (-1)^{|a||b|} ba$.\\

One remarkable fact is that Clifford algebras are closed under the graded
tensor product, i.e. the graded tensor products of two Clifford algebras is
another Clifford algebra. Likewise, the graded opposite algebra of a Clifford
algebra is again a Clifford algebra. For the remainder of this section,
we will let $\otimes$ denote the graded tensor product, and the superscript
$\text{op}$ will denote the graded opposite algebra.
%
\begin{thm}
$\Cliff_{p+t,q+s}(\R) \cong \Cliff_{p,q}(\R) \otimes \Cliff_{t,s}(\R)$
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
To give a map $\varphi : \Cliff_{p+t,q+s}(\R) \to \Cliff_{p,q}(\R) \otimes
\Cliff_{t,s}(\R)$, it is sufficient to specify its action on $\R^{p+t,q+s}$, to
check that the Clifford relations hold. Let
$\set{b_1^+,\ldots, b_{p+t}^+, b_1^-, \ldots b_{q+s}^-}$ denote the standard
orthogonal basis for $\R^{p+t|q+s}$ where $(b_i^+)^2 = 1$ and $(b_i^-)^2 = -1$.
We then define the bases $\set{e_i^\pm}$ and $\set{f_i^\pm}$ analogously for
$\R^{p,q}$ and $\R^{t,s}$ respectively. Then define $\varphi$ by
%
\begin{align*}
\varphi(b_i^+) &= \begin{cases}
e_i^+ \otimes 1 & 1 \leq i \leq p \\
1 \otimes f_i^+ & p+1 \leq i \leq p+t
\end{cases} \\
\varphi(b_i^-) &= \begin{cases}
e_i^- \otimes 1 & 1 \leq i \leq q \\
1 \otimes f_i^- & q+1 \leq i \leq q+s
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
%
This map is injective on generators, so if we show that this satisfies the
Clifford relations, then the map given by extending the map to all of
$\Cliff_{p+t,q+s}(\R)$ will be an isomorphism by dimension reasons. Showing
the Clifford relations amounts to showing
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\varphi(b_i^+)^2 = 1$
  \item $\varphi(b_i^-)^2 = -1$
  \item The images of any pair of distinct basis vectors anticommute.
\end{enumerate}
%
The first two are relations are clear from how we defined $\varphi$. To show
that the images of distinct basis vectors anticommute, there are serveral
cases to consider. Given $b_i^+$ and $b_j^+$ where $1 \leq i,j \leq p$, they
anticommute, because $e_i^+$ and $e_j^+$ anticommute. In the case where
$1 \leq i \leq p$ and $p+1 \leq j \leq p+t$, we compute
%
\begin{align*}
\varphi(b_i^+)\varphi(b_j^+) + \varphi(b_j^+)\varphi(b_i+) &=
(e_i^+ \otimes 1)(1 \otimes f_j^+) + (1\otimes f_j^+)(e_i^+ \otimes 1) \\
&= e_i^+ \otimes f_j^+ - e_i^+ \otimes f_j^+
\end{align*}
where we use the Koszul sign rule for the second term, noting that $f_j+$ and
$e_i^+$ are both odd. The proof that the images of the $b_i^-$ anti commute with
each other, as well as the proof that the images of the $b_i^+$ and $b_i^-$
anticommute are exactly the same.
%
\end{proof}
%
\begin{thm}
The graded opposite algebra $\Cliff_{p,q}^{\text{op}}$ is isomorphic to
$\Cliff_{q,p}$.
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
Fix an orthgonal basis $\set{e_i^\pm}$ for $\R^{p,q}$, where
$(e_i^\pm)^2 = \pm 1$. We note that since the $e_i^\pm$ are odd elements,
they square to $e_i^\mp$ in the opposite algebra. Indeed, the mapping
$e_i^\pm \to e_i^\mp$ defines the isomorphism
$\Cliff_{p,q}^\text{op} \to \Cliff_{q,p}$.
\end{proof}
%
Because of these theorems, once we compute a few of the lower dimensional
Clifford algebras, we will have enough data to fully classify all Clifford
algebras over $\R$.
%
\begin{exmp}[\ib{Some low dimensional examples}]\enumbreak
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Clifford algebra $\Cliff_{0,0}(\R)$ is isomorphic to $\R$.
  \item As ungraded algebras, the Clifford algebra $\Cliff_{0,1}(\R)$ is isomorphic
  to $\C$, where the isomorphism is given by $e_1 \mapsto i$.
  \item As ungraded algebras, $\Cliff_{0,2}(\R)$ is isomorphic to the quaternions
  $\H$, where the isomorphism is given by $e_1 \mapsto i$ and $e_2 \mapsto j$.
  \item As graded algebras, $\Cliff_{1,1}(\R)$ is isomorphic to $\End(\R^{1|1})$.
  The isomorphism is given by
  \[
  e_1^+ \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix} \qquad e_1^- \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  -1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  \item As ungraded algebras $\Cliff_{1,0}(\R)$ is isomorphic to the product
  algebra $\R \times \R$, where $e_1 \mapsto (1,-1)$.
  \item As ungraded algebras, $\Cliff_{2,0}(\R)$ is isomorphic to the algebra $M_2\R$
  of $2 \times 2$ matrices with coefficients in $\R$. The isomorphism is given by
  \[
  e_1 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix} \qquad e_2 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\

  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

To classify all Clifford algebras as ungraded algebras, it suffices to know
the following table: \\\\

To read the table, the bottom left entry is $\Cliff_{0,0} \cong \R$, and moving to
the right increments the signature from $(p,q)$ to $(p,q+1)$, and moving up
increments the signature $(p,q)$ to $(p+1,q)$. Any other Clifford algebra
can be obtained from an algebra on this table by tensoring with $M_{16}\R$, since
incremeting the signature by $8$ (by adding to either $p$ or $q$) results in
tensoring with $M_{16}\R$.
