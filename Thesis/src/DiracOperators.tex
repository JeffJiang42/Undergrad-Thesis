\section{Dirac Operators in $\R^n$}
%
One important application of Clifford algebras and Spin groups comes from
physics. In the process of developing a relativistic equation for the electron,
Paul Dirac saw the need for a first order differential operator $D$ such
that $D$ squared to the Laplace operator\footnote{Our reasoning for choosing this sign
convention for $\Delta$ is twofold -- one reason is that the spectrum of $\Delta$
is positive with this choice of sign, and the second is that this definition
coincides with a generalized Laplace operator on a Riemannian manifold.}.
\[
\Delta = -\sum_i \frac{\partial^2}{\partial(x^i)^2}
\]
If $D$ were the be first order, it would have to be written as
\[
D = a^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
\]
for some coefficients $a^i$. However, it is clear that choosing scalar coefficients
for the $a^i$ will not suffice. For example, in $\R^2$ with the standard coordinates
$x$ and $y$, any first order operator $D = a^1\partial_x + a^2\partial_y$ satisfies
\[
D^2 = \left(a^1\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + a^2\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^2
= (a^1)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + a^1a^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y}
+ a^2a^1 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y \partial x} + (a^2)^2 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
\]
From this equation, we see that the $a^i$ must square to $-1$, and we must also
have that $a^1a^2 + a^2a^1 = 0$ in order for the mixed partial terms to vanish.
This is not possible if the $a^i$ are scalars (in either $\R$ or $\C$).
However, the required relations are exactly the relations between orthogonal
basis vectors in the Clifford algebra $\Cliff_{0,n}(\R)$!
%
\begin{defn}
Let $\set{e_i}$ be the standard basis for $\R^n$, $\set{e^i}$ its dual basis, and
$x^1, \ldots ,x^n$ the standard coordinates on $\R^n$.
The \ib{Dirac operator} on $\R^n$ is the first order differential operator
\[
D = e^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
\]
\end{defn}
%
It is not clear from the definition what function space $D$ should act on.
The partial derivative operators make sense for any vector valued function, but
multiplcation by $e^i$ does not make sense an arbitrary vector space -- it must
be a Clifford module. Therefore, $D$ is an operator
$D: C^\infty(\R^n, M) \to C^\infty(\R^n, M)$ on smooth functions from $\R^n$
to a Clifford module $M$.
